## TODO 

#### Need to have
- change native icons to expo instead of 3rd party lib

#### Gaps
- vanilla js, not typescript
- the text highlighting is not highlighting in a span style, just the whole text view area.

## Run the app
- clone repo
- in the repo directory run `npm install; npx expo start;`
