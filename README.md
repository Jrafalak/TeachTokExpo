# TeachTok

## Description
TeachTok is a prototype of an educational app with similar UI/UX to TikTok. Users can answer questions from a variety of educational topics. This prototype only asks questions from an example playlist of AP US History multiple choice questions.

### Gaps
- vanilla js, not typescript
- the text highlighting is not highlighting in a span style, just the whole text view area.
- I had an issue with my animation libs, so for now there are arrow buttons that replace the swipe up/down interaction

### Run the app
- clone repo
- in the repo directory run `npm install; npx expo start;`
